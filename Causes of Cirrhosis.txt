Causes of Cirrhosis may include: 
Chronic alcohol use
Chronic viral hepatitis (hepatitis B and C)
Metabolic dysfunction_associated steatohepatitis (MASH, formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis/NASH). 
In parts of Asia and Africa, cirrhosis often results from endemic chronic hepatitis B.  
Cirrhosis of unknown etiology (cryptogenic cirrhosis) is becoming less common as many specific causes (eg, chronic hepatitis C, MASH) are identified. 
Injury to the bile ducts also can result in cirrhosis, as occurs in mechanical bile duct obstruction, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.
