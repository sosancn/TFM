Causes of Iron (Fe) deficiency anemia may include:
Menorrhagia.
Esophagitis, esophageal varices, hiatus hernia (ulcerated; simple hiatus hernia would not cause Fe deficiency), peptic ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, hemorrhoids, carcinoma: stomach, colorectal, (rarely angiodysplasia, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia).
Malabsorption: coeliac disease, atrophic gastritis (note: may also result from Fe deficiency), gastrectomy.
Growth spurts, pregnancy.
Vegans, elderly.
Hematuria (uncommon cause).
PNH, frequent venesection, e.g. blood donation.
Commonest cause is hookworm infestation.
