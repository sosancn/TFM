Examination for Cirrhosis includes:
Liver blood tests, coagulation tests, complete blood count (CBC), and serologic tests for viral causes
Conventional liver imaging tests: Ultrasonography, CT, MRI
Noninvasive imaging assessment of fibrosis: Transient elastography, acoustic radiation force impulse imaging, 2-dimensional shear wave elastography, magnetic resonance elastography +/- proton density fat fraction
Identification of cause based on clinical evaluation, routine testing for common causes, and selective testing for less common causes
Sometimes liver biopsy (eg, when clinical and noninvasive tests are inconclusive, or when biopsy results may change management)
