Simplest, safest and cheapest treatment for Iron (Fe) deficiency anemia is taking oral ferrous salts, e.g. FeSO4 (Fe gluconate and fumarate equally acceptable). Provide an oral dose of elemental Fe of 150_200mg/d. 
Side effects in 10_20% patients are abdominal distension, constipation and/or diarrhea. In the presence of any of these side effects try decreasing the daily dose to bd or od. 
Liquid Fe is occasionally necessary, e.g. children or adults with swallowing difficulties. 
Increasing dietary Fe intake has no routine place in the management of Fe deficiency except where intake is grossly deficient.
A rise of Hb of 2.0g/dL over 3 weeks is expected with the treatment. MCV will increase concomitantly with Hb. Reticulocytes may increase in response to Fe therapy but is not a reliable indicator of response.
Generally around 6 months. After Hb and MCV are normal continue Fe for at least 3 months to replenish Fe stores.
